ðŸ’¡ **Question 1**

Given an array, for each element find the value of the nearest element to the right which is having a frequency greater than that of the current element. If there does not exist an answer for a position, then make the value â€˜-1â€™.

**Examples:**

```
Input: a[] = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1]
Output : [-1, -1, 1, 2, 2, 1, -1]

Explanation:
Given array a[] = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1]
Frequency of each element is: 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3

Lets calls Next Greater Frequency element as NGF
1. For element a[0] = 1 which has a frequency = 3,
   As it has frequency of 3 and no other next element
   has frequency more than 3 so  '-1'
2. For element a[1] = 1 it will be -1 same logic
   like a[0]
3. For element a[2] = 2 which has frequency = 2,
   NGF element is 1 at position = 6  with frequency
   of 3 > 2
4. For element a[3] = 3 which has frequency = 1,
   NGF element is 2 at position = 5 with frequency
   of 2 > 1
5. For element a[4] = 4 which has frequency = 1,
   NGF element is 2 at position = 5 with frequency
   of 2 > 1
6. For element a[5] = 2 which has frequency = 2,
   NGF element is 1 at position = 6 with frequency
   of 3 > 2
7. For element a[6] = 1 there is no element to its
   right, hence -1
```

```
Input : a[] = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 11, 3, 3]
Output : [2, 2, 2, -1, -1, -1, -1, 3, -1, -1]

ðŸ’¡ **Question 4**

Given a Queue consisting of firstÂ **n**Â natural numbers (in random order). The task is to check whether the given Queue elements can be arranged in increasing order in another Queue using a stack. The operation allowed are:

1. Push and pop elements from the stack
2. Pop (Or Dequeue) from the given Queue.
3. Push (Or Enqueue) in the another Queue.

**Examples :**

Input :Â Queue[] = { 5, 1, 2, 3, 4 }Â 

Output :Â YesÂ 

Pop the first element of the given Queue 

i.e 5.Â Push 5 into the stack.Â 

Now, pop all the elements of the given Queue and push them toÂ second Queue.Â 

Now, pop element 5 in the stack and push it to the second Queue.Â Â Â 

Input :Â Queue[] = { 5, 1, 2, 6, 3, 4 }Â 

Output :Â NoÂ 

Push 5 to stack.Â 

Pop 1, 2 from given Queue and push it to another Queue.Â 

Pop 6 from given Queue and push to stack.Â 

Pop 3, 4 from given Queue and push to second Queue.Â 

Now, from using any of above operation, we cannot push 5Â into the second Queue because it is below the 6 in the stack.
