ðŸ’¡ **Question 1**

Given a singly linked list, deleteÂ **middle**Â of the linked list. For example, if given linked list is 1->2->**3**->4->5 then linked list should be modified to 1->2->4->5.If there areÂ **even**Â nodes, then there would beÂ **two middle**Â nodes, we need to delete the second middle element. For example, if given linked list is 1->2->3->4->5->6 then it should be modified to 1->2->3->5->6.If the input linked list is NULL or has 1 node, then it should return NULL

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5
Output:1 2 4 5

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
LinkedList: 2->4->6->7->5->1
Output:2 4 6 5 1

ðŸ’¡ **Question 2**

Given a linked list ofÂ **N**Â nodes. The task is to check if theÂ linked list has a loop. Linked list can containÂ self loop.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
N = 3
value[] = {1,3,4}
x(position at which tail is connected) = 2
Output:True
Explanation:In above test case N = 3.
The linked list with nodes N = 3 is
given. Then value ofÂ x=2 is given which
means last node is connected with xth
node of linked list. Therefore, there
exists a loop.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
N = 4
value[] = {1,8,3,4}
x = 0
Output:False
Explanation:For N = 4 ,x = 0 means
then lastNode->next = NULL, then
theÂ Linked list does not contains
any loop.

Given a linked list ofÂ **N**Â nodes such that it may contain a loop.

A loop here means that the last node of the link list is connected to the node at position X(1-based index). If the link list does not have any loop, X=0.

Remove the loop from the linked list, if it is present, i.e. unlink the last node which is forming the loop.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
N = 3
value[] = {1,3,4}
X = 2
Output:1
Explanation:The link list looks like
1 -> 3 -> 4

A loop is present. If you remove it
successfully, the answer will be 1.

Given two linked lists, insert nodes of second list into first list at alternate positions of first list.
For example, if first list is 5->7->17->13->11 and second is 12->10->2->4->6, the first list should become 5->12->7->10->17->2->13->4->11->6 and second list should become empty. The nodes of second list should only be inserted when there are positions available. For example, if the first list is 1->2->3 and second list is 4->5->6->7->8, then first list should become 1->4->2->5->3->6 and second list to 7->8.

Use of extra space is not allowed (Not allowed to create additional nodes), i.e., insertion must be done in-place. Expected time complexity is O(n) where n is number of nodes in first list.
