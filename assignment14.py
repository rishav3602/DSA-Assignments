ðŸ’¡ **Question 1**

Given a linked list ofÂ **N**Â nodes such that it may contain a loop.

A loop here means that the last node of the link list is connected to the node at position X(1-based index). If the link list does not have any loop, X=0.

Remove the loop from the linked list, if it is present, i.e. unlink the last node which is forming the loop.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
N = 3
value[] = {1,3,4}
X = 2
Output:1
Explanation:The link list looks like
1 -> 3 -> 4
     ^    |
     |____|
A loop is present. If you remove it
successfully, the answer will be 1.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
N = 4
value[] = {1,8,3,4}
X = 0
Output:1
Explanation:TheÂ Linked list does not
contains any loop.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input:
N = 4

ðŸ’¡ **Question 4**

You are given a specialÂ linked listÂ withÂ **N**Â nodes where each node has aÂ next pointer pointing to itsÂ next node. You are also givenÂ **M**Â random pointers, where you will be givenÂ **M**Â number of pairs denoting two nodesÂ **a**Â andÂ **b**Â Â **i.e.Â a->arb = b**Â (arb is pointer to random node)**.**

Construct a copy of the given list. The copy should consist of exactlyÂ **N**Â new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.

For example, if there are two nodesÂ **X**Â andÂ **Y**Â in the original list, whereÂ **X.arb**Â **-->**Â **Y**, then for the corresponding two nodesÂ **x**Â andÂ **y**Â in the copied list,Â **x.arb --> y.**

Return the head of the copied linked list.

Input:
N = 4, M = 2
value = {1,2,3,4}
pairs = {{1,2},{2,4}}
Output:1
Explanation:In this test case, there
are 4 nodes in linked list.Â  Among these
4 nodes,Â  2 nodes have arbitrary pointer
set, rest two nodes have arbitrary pointer
as NULL. Second line tells us the value
of four nodes. The third line gives the
information about arbitrary pointers.
The first node arbitrary pointer is set to
node 2.Â  The second nodeÂ arbitrary pointer
is set to node 4.
